## Project Requirements

### Content

My website features a personal profile with a photograph and a brief biography, an interactive contact form, and a dedicated projects page showcasing my work through individual project cards. It also includes direct links to my GitHub, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram profiles.
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [ ] At least 2 web pages.
- [ ] Version controlled with Git
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles.
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.
The website is built using semantic HTML and consists of two separate pages. Throughout the development process, I maintained version control by regularly committing changes to GitHub. The site is deployed using GitHub Pages. The codebase is written with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that all elements display correctly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
​
### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
