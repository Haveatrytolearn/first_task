## Project Requirements

### Content

My website features a personal profile with a photograph and a brief biography, an interactive contact form, and a dedicated projects page showcasing my work through individual project cards. It also includes direct links to my GitHub, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram profiles.
​
### Technical
This website consists of two separate pages. During development, I used Git for version control and regularly committed updates to track my progress. The site is deployed through GitHub Pages, making it accessible online. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring that it displays and functions correctly on both desktop and mobile devices.
When creating the structure of the site, I used several semantic HTML elements, including:

- header — used for the site’s header, which contains the navigation menu.

- nav — used to define the main site navigation so browsers and search engines can easily identify it.

- main — used to mark the primary content of the page.

- section — used to group the content into meaningful blocks (intro, biography, contact form, projects).

- article — used for individual project cards, each representing a standalone piece of information.

- footer — used for the bottom section of the page, which includes links to social media.

### Bonus (optional)
Among the interactive features of the website, the navigation menu stands out: the Home, Projects, and GitHub links are highlighted with a green underline when hovered over. On the Home page, several elements include hover animations — the profile photo, the Submit button, and the social media icons all slightly enlarge when the cursor moves over them.

I also implemented a dropdown list of countries in the contact form, allowing users to select their location. If the required country is not listed, the user can choose the “Another country” option, which triggers the appearance of an additional input field for entering a custom country name. The conditional display of this field was achieved using JavaScript.

In addition, each field in the contact form is designed to show visual validation feedback: fields turn green when the input is correct and red when it is invalid. The Full Name field has a rule requiring users to enter at least two words.

On the second page, the same navigation bar and footer elements are reused for consistency. The main content of this page consists of project description cards, each containing a button that will eventually lead to a separate page with the completed project.
